# **Robotics Project: Autonomous and RC Sumobot controlled by PS4 with PSBT Library**

This is a robotics project that includes an autonomous and RC (remote-controlled) sumobot, controlled by a PS4 controller using the PSBT (PlayStation Bluetooth) library. The project is designed to showcase the capabilities of robotics in creating autonomous and remote-controlled machines that can be controlled with everyday devices such as a PS4 controller.

Features
The project includes the following features:

An autonomous sumobot that can detect and respond to its environment, using a combination of sensors and programming logic.
A remote-controlled sumobot that can be controlled using a PS4 controller, with the help of the PSBT library.
A compact and portable design that makes it easy to carry and demonstrate.
Requirements
To build and run this project, you will need the following:

A microcontroller board such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi
A sumobot chassis with motors and wheels
Sensors such as ultrasonic sensors, line sensors, or infrared sensors for autonomous mode
A PS4 controller
The PSBT library
Batteries or power source for the sumobot and microcontroller
